## What is PySpark?

Python is the most popular language for data science, and for good reason.

It's easily readable, it has a rich ecosystem of packages and libraries. It's not just a powerful scripting language, 
but also supports high-level programming. Wes McKinney has a great summary of 
some of the [key benefits of Python for Big Data](https://wesmckinney.com/book/preliminaries#why_python).

This is where PySpark comes in: it allows you to leverage both the powers of both
Spark and Python!
